### A completely standalone ZEON wallet

Unlike many other wallets, ZEON mobile wallet is a real standalone ZEON
client. There is no server to get hacked or go down, so you can always access
your money. Using
[SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients)
mode, ZEON mobile wallet connects directly to the ZEON network with the fast
performance you need on a mobile device.

### The next step in wallet security

ZEON mobile wallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes,
*even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and verified boot, ZEON mobile wallet represents a significant security advance over
web and desktop wallets.

### Beautiful simplicity

Simplicity is ZEON mobile wallet's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is
all you need to restore your wallet on another device if yours is ever lost or
broken.  Because ZEON mobile wallet is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki),
your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup
phrase.
